#How does salt influence microbial communities? 

Question: 

1. How does microbial biodiversity modified across a salinity gradient?
	-Null Hypothesis: Microbial biodiversity does (e.g. richness) does not vary along a salinity gradient.
	-Hypothesis: Microbial richness will increase with lower salt concentrations.
		-There is an inverse relationship between richness and salinity.
2. How does micorbial composition change across a salinity gradient?
	-Null Hypothesis: Microbial composition does not change across a salinity gradient.
	-Hypothesis: Dominant members of the microbial community are unique to freshwater compared to salt water.
